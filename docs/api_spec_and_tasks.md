## Shared Knowledge

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the application. It uses all the other modules. The 'scanner.py' is responsible for scanning and comparing the results. The 'database.py' is responsible for storing and retrieving the scan results. The 'logger.py' is responsible for logging the discrepancies. The 'actions.py' is responsible for executing actions based on discrepancies. The 'menu.py' is responsible for displaying the scan results and discrepancies.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific actions to be automated based on the scan results need to be clarified. The layout and design of the terminal menu also need to be specified.
