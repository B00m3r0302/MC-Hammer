## Original Requirements

Develop an automated incident detection and response tool for the command prompt or powershell called MC-Hammer in C# for the windows operating system. The tool should scan the file system, operating system for user accounts, autorun and autoruns keys and values in all registry hives, and current internet connections. The scan results should be stored in a SQLite database with specific table structures. The tool should run another scan every 15 minutes, compare the current scan results to the base scan's results, store the discrepancies in the discrepancies table, log the results, and alert the user. The user interface should be a menu run in the terminal with specific features. The tool should also automate certain actions based on the scan results.

## Product Goals

- Create an efficient and effective incident detection and response tool
- Ensure accurate and timely detection of discrepancies
- Provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the tool

## User Stories

- As a system administrator, I want to be alerted of any discrepancies in my system so that I can take immediate action
- As a user, I want to be able to view the scan results in a user-friendly format so that I can easily understand the status of my system
- As a user, I want the tool to automatically take action based on the scan results so that I can ensure the security of my system
- As a user, I want to be able to customize the trusted connections so that I can control the connections to my system
- As a user, I want the tool to log the scan results so that I can review them later if needed

## Competitive Analysis

- Norton: Provides comprehensive protection but lacks a user-friendly interface
- McAfee: Offers real-time scanning but has high system requirements
- Bitdefender: Has a user-friendly interface but lacks customization options
- Avast: Offers customization options but lacks detailed logging
- Kaspersky: Provides detailed logging but lacks automatic action features
- Webroot: Has automatic action features but lacks real-time scanning
- ESET: Offers real-time scanning but lacks a user-friendly interface

## Requirement Analysis

The tool should be developed in C# for the Windows operating system. It should scan the file system, user accounts, registry hives, and internet connections, and store the results in a SQLite database. The tool should run another scan every 15 minutes and compare the current scan results to the base scan's results. The discrepancies should be stored in a separate table and the user should be alerted. The tool should also automate certain actions based on the scan results. The user interface should be a terminal menu with specific features.

## Requirement Pool

- ['Develop the tool in C#', 'P0']
- ['Implement scanning features', 'P0']
- ['Store scan results in a SQLite database', 'P0']
- ['Implement comparison and alerting features', 'P0']
- ['Develop a user-friendly terminal menu', 'P0']

## UI Design draft

The user interface should be a terminal menu with a clean and simple design. It should display the scan results in a clear and organized manner. There should be a progress bar for the ongoing scan, timers for the current scan and the next scan, and an option to view the discrepancies. The menu should also allow users to add or remove values from the TrustedConnections table.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific actions to be automated based on the scan results need to be clarified. The layout and design of the terminal menu also need to be specified.
